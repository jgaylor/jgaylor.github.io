    <h3>What does a typical day look like?</h3>
    <p>We believe that children should have meaningful experiences with the world outside the classroom, which is why students at our school are given time to play outdoors as well as in the space and given the resources they need to sustain their curiosity and become inspired, independent learners.  We are inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach to education; our goal is to nurture the spirit of inquiry and play that children naturally bring to everything they do.  At Brooklyn Apple, we provide the space, tools and opportunity for children to use their hands to develop their minds. 1, 2, 3, and 4 day options available. (Please inquire)</p>
